description: "A presentation at the European Union Digital Identity Wallet launchpad event in December 2025 which covers the Digital Credentials API and how it bridges the gap between verifiers, issuers, and wallets. The session focuses on what a good API must deliver: format neutrality, cross-platform compatibility, clear user prompts/consent, proximity and remote flows, and graceful fallback."
