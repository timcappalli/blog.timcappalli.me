## Topics

At TPAC 2023, we introduced the topic of digital identity wallets and their use on the web, and asked the community for use cases, concerns, and asked browser engine maintainers to express interest in this work.

This evolved into a work item in the WICG, the Digital Credentials API, where folks from multiple communities involved in the digitally verifiable credentials space (including other W3C CGs and WGs, the OpenID Foundation, national standards organizations, privacy experts, issuers, verifiers, wallet makers, and more) have been working together to provide a safe, secure, privacy preserving method of sharing digital credentials on the web.
