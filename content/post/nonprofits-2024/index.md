As 2024 draws to a close, I'm grateful for the many organizations working tirelessly to make the world a better place. Here are a few nonprofits that have captured my heart and inspired me to give back in 2024.

## [Digital Identity Advancement Foundation](https://digitalidadvancement.org/)

> The Foundation’s goal is to foster global opportunities for people to study and explore digital identity. The Foundation helps address a critical problem in digital identity today: a global lack of diverse talent and knowhow. As a charitable organization, it seeks to grow the practice of digital identity through the issuance of scholarships and grants.

Vittorio Bertocci was a very close friend of mine and he cared deeply about getting new folks involved in the identity world.

## The Trevor Project

> The Trevor Project is the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit organization for LGBTQ+ young people. We provide information & support to LGBTQ+ young people 24/7, all year round.

The next four years are shaping up to be a very challenging time for many people, especially LGBTQ+ young people. Acceptance from at least one adult can decrease the risk of LGBTQ+ youth attempting suicide by 40%.

## [Signal Foundation](https://signalfoundation.org/) ([Signal App](https://signal.org/))

> Signal Foundation formed in 2018 to support Signal Messenger which originated in 2012. Through the Foundation, we have been able to support Signal's growth and ongoing operations as well as investigate the future of private communication.

Technology is about bringing people together, not dividing them. Unfortunately [some tech companies](https://apple.com) only care about privacy and human rights if you spend thousands of dollars on their products. People should be able to easily and securely communicate with each other, regardless of the devices they use. Signal is an independent non-profit without ties to any major big tech companies, and the Signal app runs on nearly every phone, tablet, and computer out there today.

## [Transit Matters](https://transitmatters.org/)

> TransitMatters advances people-focused and data-driven solutions to advocate for better public transportation and mobility that provides access and opportunities for everyone across the Commonwealth, addresses climate change and inequality, and strengthens our economy.

Public transit is the cornerstone of equitable, sustainable, and thriving cities and is very important to me. I've been car-free for over 8 years and use Boston's public transit and urban mobility infrastructure daily.

_*“A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.”*_ ― Gustavo Petro
