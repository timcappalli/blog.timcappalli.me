title: The Past, Present, and Future of Passkeys @ Internet2 TechEx 2024
description: Passkeys arrived on the scene in 2022 with yet another promise of freeing us all from passwords. Have we actually made any progress on that goal? We'll dive into the journey to passkeys, how they work, the improvements to security and user experience, (hopefully!) clear up some misconceptions, and offer some reflection on pain points at global scale. We'll also take a look into the future with the intersection of passkeys, federation, and digital identity wallets.
